This is app. is a remix on the classic About Me app. Instead of being an About Me app, it's an About You app.

I used 2 stack navigation schemes: one is in App.js starting on line 23 and going for many lines, and the other is in FavoritePlacesNew.js starting on line 19 and going for many lines.

I used at least 3 hooks: useContext in App.js starting on line 1, and useEffect and useState in FavoritePlacesNew.js starting on line 1.

The database is referenced in the util folder, then in database.js. The whole file is database code.

Adding to the database is found at database.js, starting at line 33 and goes for several lines.

Deleting from the database is found at database.js, starting at line 119 and goes for several lines.

Maps are used in several files: screens/Map.js, components/Places/LocationPicker.js, util/location.js, and models/place.js.

User authentication is used throughout the app.

The camera is used and accesses images too: ImagePicker.js
